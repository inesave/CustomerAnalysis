## What do you know about customer segmentation?
Customer segmentation allows companies to separate their set of customers into different groups or clusters that share traits. Once the clusters are created, the company can tailor their marketing campaigns to the specific groups, improving the campaign’s impact or conversion rate.

## What are the steps in this analysis?
1. Clean and understand your data
2. Choose the right model for data clustering
3. Analyze the clusters to find the unifying traits
